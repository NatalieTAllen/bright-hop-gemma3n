Bright Hop - Gemma 3n Impact Challenge Submission
🐰 Project Overview
"Closing gaps, one bright hop at a time"
Bright Hop is an AI-powered educational platform that addresses the critical learning gap crisis affecting millions of students worldwide. Using Google's Gemma 3n model, we create personalized, offline-first learning experiences that ensure every child—regardless of zip code, internet access, or background—gets the support they need to succeed.
🎯 Problem Statement
The Learning Gap Crisis
* 73% of 4th graders in the US read below proficient levels
* 40% of students graduate high school without college or career-ready math skills
